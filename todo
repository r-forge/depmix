
TODO list for depmix package release 0.2-0

1) make C versions of fb and lystig to speed things up a little bit 
(have a look at the profile code in depmixNew-test4.R to see where 
the speed problems are)

2) adjust freepars to take care of constraints

3) add examples of response models, ie binomial etc:
	a) specify a model
	b) generate data
	c) fit the model to check parameter recovery

Ingmar

1) JSS paper opzetje maken


Maarten

1) Simulate examples (see 3 above) (done...by Ingmar)




TODO Medium term

1) look at initial value generation?

2) Discrimination learning example, need covariates with these data!

3) Factor depmix model as example of user specified model


TODO long term 

Design issues

1) Data simulation according to specified model

2) Analytical gradients in lystig + standard errors of parameters

3) Multi group possibilities: use group factor in call to depmix

4) Missing data options?


Other capabilities

1) Look at log and exp of matrices to have continuous time observations
(also see mlm)

2) Look at HMISC for mapply -> multivariate apply for mv densities

3) Look at package ks for mv normal mixture densities

4) Check flexclust package for an example of extending models

5) Check glmc pack for constrained glm models!!!!!

6) stochmod pack for stochastic models

7) use relevel function to recode factors into different base

8) Standard errors (Hessian) for EM (computed by e.g. Louis' method)
