
TODO list for paper

1) do extensive testing:
	- generate data for response models and parameter recovery (mostly
	done in the test files)
	- similarly for actual markov models and mixture models

2) add example of adding new response model to JSS paper (still looking
for a good candidate model ...)

3) check models with boundary values in the transition and initial
state probabilities (possibly work on identity link for multinomial
models, but this involves also adding parstruct or something like it
to the response models to incorporate linear constraints within those
parameter vectors)

4) write the paper

5) balance data set refs toevoegen en toestemming vragen aan Brenda, data set 
reduceren dmv random subset

6) Tests: 
	- make output files for test files


TODO Medium term

1) Discrimination learning example, need covariates with these data!

2) Factor depmix model as example of user specified model

3) Discrimination learning example: find data set with interesting covariates


TODO long term 

Design issues

1) Multi group possibilities: use group factor in call to depmix??

2) Missing data options?


Other capabilities

1) Look at log and exp of matrices to have continuous time observations
(also see mlm)

2) Look at HMISC for mapply -> multivariate apply for mv densities

3) Look at package ks for mv normal mixture densities

4) Check flexclust package for an example of extending models

5) Check glmc pack for constrained glm models

6) stochmod pack for stochastic models

7) use relevel function to recode factors into different base categories

8) Standard errors (Hessian) for EM (computed by e.g. Louis' method)
