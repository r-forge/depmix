
TODO list for paper

1) do extensive testing

2) add example of adding new response model

3) check models with boundary values in the transition and initial
state probabilities (possibly work on identity link for multinomial
models, but this involves also adding parstruct or something like it
to the response models to incorporate linear constraints within those
parameter vectors)

4) write the paper

5) bugs in transInit met covariaat met 3 level factor?

6) bug in nlin: see lincon versus linconFull in depmixfit.R

7) help voor fixed, equal constraints opgeven

8) check bug in posterior versus viterbi bij de modellen van Maartje

9) 



TODO Medium term

1) look at initial value generation?

2) Discrimination learning example, need covariates with these data!

3) Factor depmix model as example of user specified model

4) make C versions of fb and lystig to speed things up a little bit 
(have a look at the profile code in depmixNew-test4.R to see where 
the speed problems are)

5) Change stop criterion in EM: make it relative to the magnitude of the 
likelihood to avoid overly long iterations with large likelihoods, ie for 
thousands of cases


TODO long term 

Design issues

1) Analytical gradients in lystig + standard errors of parameters

2) Multi group possibilities: use group factor in call to depmix??

3) Missing data options?


Other capabilities

1) Look at log and exp of matrices to have continuous time observations
(also see mlm)

2) Look at HMISC for mapply -> multivariate apply for mv densities

3) Look at package ks for mv normal mixture densities

4) Check flexclust package for an example of extending models

5) Check glmc pack for constrained glm models!!!!!

6) stochmod pack for stochastic models

7) use relevel function to recode factors into different base

8) Standard errors (Hessian) for EM (computed by e.g. Louis' method)
