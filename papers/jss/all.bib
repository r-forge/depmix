The probabilities of combinations of substrings have to be known for the construction of the model to work, i.e., the joint probabilities of two following substrings has to be known for all possible combinations of substrings. This results in a Hankel matrix of infinite order. Anderson shows that this matrix can be factored into the matrices of an HMM. Further work is needed to see if this is possible given only a finite fragment of the Hankel matrix concerned. The proof provides an upper limit to the number of states of the HMM: the maximal number of states is the row rank of the Hankel matrix. This could possibly be applied in finite data examples to provide a maximum for the number of states that needs to be estimated.},

The main trick it seems is to consider internal state representations, that is the points in the hidden state space of the network, as prior knowledge. Also they use a sigmoidal function that approximates threshold units, $1+\tanh(mx)/2$ where $m$ increases during training. This results in internal dynamics of the network to approach only the corners of the hidden state space.},

	Abstract = {
   Publisher's description: The likelihood plays a key 
   role both in introducing general notions of statistical theory and 
   in developing specific methods.  This book introduces 
   likelihood-based statistical theory and related methods from a 
   classical viewpoint, and demonstrates how the main body of 
   currently used statistical techniques can be generated from a few 
   key concepts, in particular the likelihood.

   Focusing on those methods which have both a solid theoretical 
   background and practical relevance, the author gives formal 
   justification of the methods used and provides numerical answers 
   with real data.

   Statistical inference is aimed at graduate students and researchers 
   in statistics and applied statistics.

	Summary = {Authors present reestimation formulas for hidden markov model parameters for on-line learning, that is, after each training sequence has been received. On-line thus refers to not waiting for all the sequences to come in before starting reestimation. They incidentally show that the weight factors that should be applied when reestimating on the basis of multiple sequences can be dropped without loss of convergence properties (although occasionally small drops in the loglikelihood may occur). They reparametrize parameters by taking the (weighted) exponent. This transformation leads to a representation as a linear Boltzmann chain with normalized weights. This also results in the impossibility of having transmission or emission probabilities equal to zero.},

They attain good results with inference of the Tomita grammars which however do not have any inputs, so the case for their architecture is somewhat lost. Moreover, they rely on computing partial derivatives of the likelihood to the weigths in output and state transition subnetworks which are vanishingly small in long timeseries.},

Also brief review of intentional versus accidental learning: it seems in general true that implicit learning is rather unsensitive to distractions. The case against rule abstraction is made by transference experiments: hypothetical rule induction would make transfer easier but this is disconfirmed by several, albeit not all, experiments. The case against chunk learning is made by saying that RTs on the individual letters of a chunk should be equally fast but this is not the case.},

Author tests different values of the learning rate and momentum term to see which ones provide optimal learning times, counted as the number of epochs to the training set. Fahlman introduces the quick-prop algorithm as a useful modification to obtain faster learning with back-prop. Quick-prop works on the assumption that using higher-order information about the error surface leads to increased performance, just as the momentum term does. Actually computing the second derivative of the error surface is however very costly, certainly for large networks containing thousands of weights and hence an approximation is needed. The approximation used is the ratio of the current slope and the difference between the previous slope and the current slope.},

That is, it seems that the representations in our heads have intrinsic meaning that an autonomous symbol as such can never have. Or as Fodor puts it: the symbols have to connected to the world in the right manner, and leaves it at that. Harnad however argues that in this connection the possibility of symbols to denote anything is lost and hence there is no autonomous symbol system anymore. Symbols, as arbitrary signs, should indeed be connected in the right way with the world and connectionist models are viewed by Harnad as a possibility to do so. That is, a neural network categorizes incoming data into the categories that make up our language. The symbol system that cognition, does its work on top of this structure such that symbols are, causally, connected with the things they refer. Only basic categories of things need to be grounded in this way. More complex concepts can then be built up of these basic, grounded concepts/categories.},

In particular they investigate the possibility where the number of output units is larger than the number of input units. In such a case informational constraints need to be imposed on the learning process to yield unique solutions. They used constraint auch as that a sequence of output activations has minimal entropy by adding a penalty term to the error function such that the distribution of the output units are unimodal and peaked around zero. The use of such networks with more output than input units is justified with an appeal to for example layers of the visual cortex that have many more units than the retina.},

DFAs are constructed by feeding the network with input and noting the resulting transition in the partitioned state-space. A new DFA-state is formed when a new partition is visited for the first time. The transitions between the DFA-states are labeled with the input of the network that causes the transition. Since different partitioning can result in different DFAs a model selection criterion is needed. Omlin \& Giles propose to select the smallest consistent DFA resulting from the smallest quantization level. With consistency they mean that the DFA should be consistent with the training set that was presented to the network.},

A special feature of these networks is that also the activation dynamics are not fixed over time, that is, in the recall phase the weights are allowed to change over trials, or continuously in time.},

	Abstract = {A serial reaction time (RT) (SRT) experiment
  investigated whether there are 2 independent forms of implicit
  learning: learning that is linked to making judgments about
  stimuli, and learning that is linked to motor processing.  180
  Ss performed 2, 6, or 12 blocks of single task SRT, dual task
  SRT, or observation with 1 of 5 sequences; each sequence had
  the same underlying structure.  Ss then performed 2 implicit
  tests, SRT (a motor-linked test) and pattern judgment, as well
  as a generation test and an explicit knowledge test.  Results
  show a double dissociation of the effect of sequence surface
  structure on SRT and pattern judgment.  SRT and pattern
  judgment competence developed independently of each other
  across length of acquisition task.  Performance on both
  implicit tasks did not depend on explicit knowledge.  These
  results indicate that the SRT and pattern judgment measures tap
  independent forms of implicit learning, which is consistent
  with the modular nature of memory and cognition.},

	Summary = {Authors use HMMs for automata induction from data. They outline a Bayesian approach to estimation of parameters, starting out with a saturated model, i.e.\ a model that has a state for each data point. This latter feature renders the method impractical for large datasets although authors mention online learning as an option. Most priors they chose are non-informative except possibly the structure prior for the number of states in a model which effectively gives a penalty for increasing numbers of states. However, the magnitude of this penalty is not given. In their automata induction example authors use a description length prior, which comes down to counting the number of non-zero parameters (which implicitly incorporates the number of states). Furthermore they use a Dirichlet prior for the parameter values which is biased to produce zeroes and ones in the transition and emission matrices but is generally uninformative. Also they maximize the Maximum Posterior Probability. The method seems very much to be identical to using AIC as selection criterion where the AIC is adjusted to only count the non-zero parameters.},

Sun also brings Heideggers Dasein to the fore which introduces not only perceptual grounding but also action-goal based grounding of symbols. All this is very interesting and completely fails to be captured by the model he then proposes although it does contain learning mechanisms that are supposed to take care of the grounding.},

	Abstract = {The processes of overall similarity sorting were investigated in 5 free classification experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that increasing time pressure can reduce the likelihood of overall similarity categorization. Experiment 3 showed that a concurrent load also reduced overall similarity sorting. These findings suggest that overall similarity sorting can be a time-consuming analytic process. Such results appear contrary to the idea that overall similarity is a nonanalytic process (e.g., T. B. Ward, 1983) but are in line with F. N. Milton and A. J. Wills's (2004) dimensional summation hypothesis and with the stochastic sampling assumptions of the extended generalized context model (K. Lamberts, 2000). Experiments 4 and 5 demonstrated that the relationship between stimulus presentation time and overall similarity sorting is nonmonotonic, and the shape of the function is consistent with the idea that the three aforementioned processes operate over different parts of the time course.},

In 3 experiments, the dimensions were all perfectly valid predictors of the response that would be reinforced and mutually redundant: in 2 others. they varied in Validity. In tests with stimuli in which 1 of the 3 dimensions took an anomalous value, most but not all individuals of both species categorized them in terms of single dimensions. When information was delivered as a function of the passage of time, some students, but no pigeons, waited for the most useful information, especially when the cues differed in objective validity. When the subjects could control information delivery, both species obtained information selectively. When cue validities varied, almost all Students tended to choose the most valid cues, and when all cues were valid, some chose the cues by which they classified test stimuli. Only a few pigeons chose the most useful information in either situation. Despite their tendency to unidimensional categorization, the pigeons showed no evidence of rule-governed behavior. but students followed a simple "take-the-best" rule.},

	Abstract = {Pigeons (Columba livia), gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), and undergraduates (Homo sapiens) learned discrimination tasks involving multiple mutually redundant dimensions. First, pigeons and undergraduates learned conditional discriminations between stimuli composed of three spatially separated dimensions, after first learning to discriminate the individual elements of the stimuli. When subsequently tested with stimuli in which one of the dimensions took an anomalous value, the majority of both species categorized test stimuli by their overall similarity to training stimuli. However some individuals of both species categorized them according to a single dimension. In a second set of experiments, squirrels, pigeons, and undergraduates learned go/no-go discriminations using multiple Simultaneous presentations of stimuli composed of three spatially integrated, highly salient dimensions. The tendency to categorize test stimuli including anomalous dimension values unidimensionally was higher than in the first set of experiments and did not differ significantly between species. The authors conclude that unidimensional categorization of multidimensional stimuli is not diagnostic for analytic cognitive processing, and that any differences between human's and pigeons' behavior in such tasks are not due to special features of avian visual cognition.},

@article{Pothos2005,
	Abstract = {The distinction between rules and similarity is central to our understanding of much of cognitive psychology. Two aspects of existing research have motivated the present work. First, in different cognitive psychology areas we typically see different conceptions of rules and similarity; for example, rules in language appear to be of a different kind compared to rules in categorization. Second, rules processes are typically modeled as separate from similarity ones; for example, in a learning experiment, rules and similarity influences would be described on the basis of separate models. in the present article, I assume that the rules versus similarity distinction can be understood in the same way in learning, reasoning, categorization, and language, and that a unified model for rules and similarity is appropriate. A rules process is considered to be a similarity one where only a single or a small subset of an object's properties are involved. Hence, rules and overall similarity operations are extremes in a single continuum of similarity operations. It is argued that this viewpoint allows adequate coverage of theory and empirical findings in learning, reasoning, categorization, and language, and also a reassessment of the objectives in research on rules versus similarity.},

	Abstract = {Three- to 4-month-old infants show asymmetric exclusivity in the acquisition of cat and dog perceptual categories. The cat perceptual category excludes dog exemplars, but the dog perceptual category does not exclude cat exemplars. We describe a connectionist autoencoder model of perceptual categorization that shows the same asymmetries as infants. The model predicts the presence of asymmetric retroactive interference when infants acquire cat and dog categories sequentially. A subsequent experiment conducted with 3- to 4-month-olds verifies the predicted pattern of looking time behaviors. We argue that bottom-up, associative learning systems with distributed representations are appropriate for modeling the operation of short-term visual memory in early perceptual category learning.

	Abstract = {Comparison mechanisms have been implicated in the development of abstract, relational thought, including object categorization. D. Gentner and L. L. Namy (1999) found that comparing 2 perceptually similar category members yielded taxonomic categorization, whereas viewing a single member of the target category elicited shallower perceptual responding. The present experiments tested 2 predictions that follow from Gentner and Namy's (1999) model: (a) Comparison facilitates categorization only when the targets to be compared share relational commonalities, and (b) providing common labels for targets invites comparison, whereas providing conflicting labels deters it. Four-year-olds participated in a forced-choice task. They viewed 2 perceptually similar target objects and were asked to "find another one." Results suggest an important role for comparison in lexical and conceptual development.},

The model suggests that (a) linguistic labels contribute to the perceived similarity of compared entities and (b) categorization and induction are a function of similarity computed over perceptual information and linguistic labels. The model also predicts young children's similarity judgment, induction, and categorization performance under different stimuli and task conditions. Predictions of the model were tested and confirmed in 6 experiments, in which 4- to 5-year-olds performed similarity judgment, induction, and categorization tasks using artificial and real labels (Experiments 1-4) and recognition memory tasks (Experiments 5A and 5B). Results corroborate the similarity-based account of young children's induction and categorization, and they support both qualitative and quantitative predictions of the model.},

	Abstract = {Similarity-based and rule-based accounts of cognition are often portrayed as opposing accounts. In this paper we suggest that in learning and development, the process of comparison can act as a bridge between similarity-based and rule-based processing, We suggest that comparison involves a process of structural alignment and mapping between two representations. This kind of structure-sensitive comparison process - which may be triggered either by experiential or symbolic juxtapositions - has a twofold significance for cognitive development. First, as a learning mechanism, comparison facilitates the grasp of structural commonalities and the abstraction of rules; and, second, as a mechanism for the application and extension of previously acquired knowledge, comparison processes facilitate the application of abstract knowledge to new instances.

	Abstract = {The distinction between rule-based and similarity-based processes in cognition is of fundamental importance for cognitive science, and has been the focus of a large body of empirical research. However, intuitive uses of the distinction are subject to theoretical difficulties and their relation to empirical evidence is not clear. We propose a 'core' distinction between rule-and similarity-based processes, in terms of the way representations of stored information are 'matched' with the representation of a novel item. This explication captures the intuitively clear-cut cases of processes of each type, and resolves apparent problems with the rule/similarity distinction. Moreover, it provides a clear target for assessing the psychological and Al literatures. We show that many lines of psychological evidence are less conclusive than sometimes assumed, but suggest that converging lines of evidence may be persuasive. that the Al literature suggests that approaches which combine rules and similarity are an important new focus for empirical work.

	Abstract = {The authors propose a rule-plus-exception (RULEX) model for how observers classify stimuli residing in continuous-dimension spaces. The model follows in the spirit of the discrete-dimension version of RULEX developed by Nosofsky, Palmeri, and McKinley (1994). According to the model, observers learn categories by forming simple logical rules along single dimensions and by remembering occasional exceptions to those rules. In the continuous-dimension version of RULEX, the rules are formalized in terms of linear decision boundaries that are orthogonal to the coordinate axes of the psychological space. In addition, a similarity-comparison process governs whether stored exceptions are used to classify an object. The model provides excellent quantitative fits both to averaged classification transfer data and to distributions of generalizations observed at the individual-participant level The modeling analyses suggest that, when multiple rules are available for solving a problem, averaged classification data often represent a probabilistic mixture of idiosyncratic rule-plus-exception strategies.},

@article{Kloos2008,
	Abstract = {This research examined how differences in category structure affect category learning and category representation across points of development. The authors specifically focused on category density-or the proportion of category-relevant variance to the total variance. Results of Experiments 1-3 showed a clear dissociation between dense and sparse categories: Whereas dense categories were readily learned without supervision, learning of sparse categories required supervision. There were also developmental differences in how statistical density affected category representation. Although children represented both dense and sparse categories on the basis of the overall similarity (Experiment 4A), adults represented dense categories on the basis of similarity and represented sparse categories on the basis of the inclusion rule (Experiment 4B). The results support the notion that statistical structure interacts with the learning regime in their effects on category learning. In addition, these results elucidate important developmental differences in how categories are represented, which presents interesting challenges for theories of categorization.},

@article{Minda2008,
	Abstract = {Three experiments investigated the ability of 3, 5, and 8-year-old children as well as adults to learn sets of perceptual categories. Adults and children performed comparably on categories that could be learned by either a single-dimensional rule or by associative learning mechanisms. However, children showed poorer performance relative to adults in learning categories defined by a disjunctive rule and categories that were nonlinearly separable. Increasing the task demands for adults resulted in child-like performance on the disjunctive categories. Decreasing the task demands for children resulted in more adult-like performance on the disjunctive categories. The authors interpret these results within a multiple-systems approach to category learning and suggest that children have not fully developed the same explicit category learning system as adults.},

@article{Mash2006,
	Abstract = {The current work examined age differences in the classification of novel object images that vary in continuous dimensions of structural shape. The structural dimensions employed are two that share a privileged status in the visual analysis and representation of objects: the shape of discrete prominent parts and the attachment positions of those parts. Experiment 1 involved a triad classification task in which participants at each of three different ages (5 years, 8 years, and adult) classified object images from two distinct stimulus sets. Across both sets, the youngest children demonstrated a systematic bias toward the shape of discrete parts during their judgments. With increasing age, participants increasingly came to select both the shape and the position of parts when classifying the images. The findings from Experiment 2 indicate that the local shape bias observed in young children's classifications is not merely a consequence of a discrimination advantage for that dimension. Results are discussed in relation to corresponding age-related changes in other functional contexts of visual processing. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Participants learned simple and complex category structures under typical single-task conditions and when performing a simultaneous numerical Stroop task. In the simple categorization tasks, each set of contrasting categories was separated by a unidimensional explicit rule, whereas the complex tasks required integrating information from three stimulus dimensions and resulted in implicit rules that were difficult to verbalize. The concurrent Stroop task dramatically impaired learning of the simple explicit rules, but did not significantly delay learning of the complex implicit rules. These results support the hypothesis that category learning is mediated by multiple learning systems.},

@article{Ashby2005,
	Abstract = {Much recent evidence suggests some dramatic differences in the way people learn perceptual categories, depending on exactly how the categories were constructed. Four different kinds of category-learning tasks are currently popular-rule-based tasks, information-integration tasks, prototype distortion tasks, and the weather prediction task. The cognitive, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging results obtained using these four tasks are qualitatively different. Success in rule-based (explicit reasoning) tasks depends on frontal-striatal circuits and requires working memory and executive attention. Success in information-integration tasks requires a form of procedural learning and is sensitive to the nature and timing of feedback. Prototype distortion tasks induce perceptual (visual cortical) learning. A variety of different strategies can lead to success in the weather prediction task. Collectively, results from these four tasks provide strong evidence that human category learning is mediated by multiple, qualitatively distinct systems.},

	Abstract = {The effect of a working-memory-demanding dual task on perceptual category learning was investigated. In Experiment 1, participants learned unidimensional rule-based or information integration category structures. In Experiment 2, participants learned a conjunctive rule-based category structure. In Experiment 1, unidimensional rule-based category learning was disrupted more by the dual working memory task than was information integration category learning. In addition, rule-based category learning differed qualitatively from information integration category learning in yielding a bimodal, rather than a normal, distribution of scores. Experiment 2 showed that rule-based learning can be disrupted by a dual working memory task even when both dimensions are relevant for optimal categorization. The results support the notion of at least two systems of category learning: a hypothesis-testing system that seeks verbalizable rules and relies on working memory and selective attention, and an implicit system that is procedural-learning based and is essentially automatic.},

	Abstract = {The ability to follow explicit rules improves dramatically during the course of childhood, but relatively little is known about the changes in brain structure and function that underlie this behavioral improvement. Drawing from neuroscientific studies in human adults and other animals, as well as from an emerging literature in developmental cognitive neuroscience, we propose a brain-based account of the development of rule use in childhood. This account focuses on four types of rules represented in different parts of the prefrontal cortex: simple rules for reversing stimulus-reward associations, pairs of conditional stimulus-response rules (both univalent and bivalent), and higher-order stimulus-response rules for selecting among task sets. It is hypothesized that the pattern of developmental changes in rule use reflects the different rates of development of specific regions within the prefrontal cortex.},
