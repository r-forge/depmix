Review of 

depmixS4 : An R-package for hidden Markov models
by Ingmar Visser, Maarten Speekenbrink

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a well-written paper reporting on a substantial package that will
be of interest to researchers in many fields.  

I installed the package from CRAN and noted the warning:
Warning: ./man/depmix-internal.Rd:39: All text must be in a section

The authors should consider fixing this.  

Section 3: 

Authors should show 

library("depmixS4")
data("speed") 

likewise

data("balance")

since readers not familiar with R may not know how to load this data otherwise.

It may be preferable to submit the paper as a Sweave file, but I leave it to 
the authors whether they want to make this change.  In any case, if they could
please submit a .R script containing all the code in the paper, that would be 
helpful.
