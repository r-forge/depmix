@article{Meeter2006,
	Abstract = {The "Weather Prediction" task is a widely used task for investigating
	probabilistic category learning, in which various cues are probabilistically
	(but not perfectly) predictive of class membership. This means that
	a given combination of cues sometimes belongs to one class and sometimes
	to another. Prior studies showed that subjects can improve their
	performance with training, and that there is considerable individual
	variation in the strategies subjects use to approach this task. Here,
	we discuss a recently introduced analysis of probabilistic categorization,
	which attempts to identify the strategy followed by a participant.
	Monte Carlo simulations show that the analysis can, indeed, reliably
	identify such a strategy if it is used, and can identify switches
	from one strategy to another. Analysis of data from normal young
	adults shows that the fitted strategy can predict subsequent responses.
	Moreover, learning is shown to be highly nonlinear in probabilistic
	categorization. Analysis of performance of patients with dense memory
	impairments due to hippocampal damage shows that although these patients
	can change strategies, they are as likely to fall back to an inferior
	strategy as to move to more optimal ones.},
