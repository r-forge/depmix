Title: A Framework for Modelling Discrete Change

Author: Ingmar Visser


Abstract

A class of models is developed for measuring and detecting discrete change
in learning and development.  The basic model for detecting such change is
the latent or hidden Markov model.  Traditionally, these models were
restricted to categorical, mostly binary, observed variables, placing
severe restrictions on possible measurement models.  In this paper, the
basic model is extended to include arbitrary distributions for the observed
variables, including multi-variate distributions.  Moreover, there is
optional support to include time-varying predictors.  In effect, this model
consists of mixtures of general linear models with Markovian depencies over
time to model the change process.  In addition, transition parameters can
be made to depend on covariates as well, such that the switching regime
between states depends on characteristics of the individual or the
experimental situation.  The model is illustrated with several examples
from experimental psychology and categorization learning.
