The probabilities of combinations of substrings have to be known for the construction of the model to work, i.e., the joint probabilities of two following substrings has to be known for all possible combinations of substrings. This results in a Hankel matrix of infinite order. Anderson shows that this matrix can be factored into the matrices of an HMM. Further work is needed to see if this is possible given only a finite fragment of the Hankel matrix concerned. The proof provides an upper limit to the number of states of the HMM: the maximal number of states is the row rank of the Hankel matrix. This could possibly be applied in finite data examples to provide a maximum for the number of states that needs to be estimated.},

Also they use a sigmoidal function that approximates threshold units, $1+\tanh(mx)/2$ where $m$ increases during training. This results in internal dynamics of the network to approach only the corners of the hidden state space.},

	Abstract = {
   Publisher's description: The likelihood plays a key 
   role both in introducing general notions of statistical theory and 
   in developing specific methods.  This book introduces 
   likelihood-based statistical theory and related methods from a 
   classical viewpoint, and demonstrates how the main body of 
   currently used statistical techniques can be generated from a few 
   key concepts, in particular the likelihood.

   Focusing on those methods which have both a solid theoretical 
   background and practical relevance, the author gives formal 
   justification of the methods used and provides numerical answers 
   with real data.

   Statistical inference is aimed at graduate students and researchers 
   in statistics and applied statistics.

On-line thus refers to not waiting for all the sequences to come in before starting reestimation. They incidentally show that the weight factors that should be applied when reestimating on the basis of multiple sequences can be dropped without loss of convergence properties (although occasionally small drops in the loglikelihood may occur). They reparametrize parameters by taking the (weighted) exponent. This transformation leads to a representation as a linear Boltzmann chain with normalized weights. This also results in the impossibility of having transmission or emission probabilities equal to zero.},

They attain good results with inference of the Tomita grammars which however do not have any inputs, so the case for their architecture is somewhat lost. Moreover, they rely on computing partial derivatives of the likelihood to the weigths in output and state transition subnetworks which are vanishingly small in long timeseries.},

Author tests different values of the learning rate and momentum term to see which ones provide optimal learning times, counted as the number of epochs to the training set. Fahlman introduces the quick-prop algorithm as a useful modification to obtain faster learning with back-prop. Quick-prop works on the assumption that using higher-order information about the error surface leads to increased performance, just as the momentum term does. Actually computing the second derivative of the error surface is however very costly, certainly for large networks containing thousands of weights and hence an approximation is needed. The approximation used is the ratio of the current slope and the difference between the previous slope and the current slope.},

That is, it seems that the representations in our heads have intrinsic meaning that an autonomous symbol as such can never have. Or as Fodor puts it: the symbols have to connected to the world in the right manner, and leaves it at that. Harnad however argues that in this connection the possibility of symbols to denote anything is lost and hence there is no autonomous symbol system anymore. Symbols, as arbitrary signs, should indeed be connected in the right way with the world and connectionist models are viewed by Harnad as a possibility to do so. That is, a neural network categorizes incoming data into the categories that make up our language. The symbol system that cognition, does its work on top of this structure such that symbols are, causally, connected with the things they refer. Only basic categories of things need to be grounded in this way. More complex concepts can then be built up of these basic, grounded concepts/categories.},

They used constraint auch as that a sequence of output activations has minimal entropy by adding a penalty term to the error function such that the distribution of the output units are unimodal and peaked around zero. The use of such networks with more output than input units is justified with an appeal to for example layers of the visual cortex that have many more units than the retina.},

The effect is a carry-over of the affective value/evaluative value of the associated stimulus to the neutral stimulus. The process is called implicit learning but it comes nowhere close to the stuff that is studied in sequence learning because the structure of the associations is very simple: only one simple association is formed between two stimuli instead of complex compounds or series of stimuli such as in sequence learning.},

DFAs are constructed by feeding the network with input and noting the resulting transition in the partitioned state-space. A new DFA-state is formed when a new partition is visited for the first time. The transitions between the DFA-states are labeled with the input of the network that causes the transition. Since different partitioning can result in different DFAs a model selection criterion is needed. Omlin \& Giles propose to select the smallest consistent DFA resulting from the smallest quantization level. With consistency they mean that the DFA should be consistent with the training set that was presented to the network.},

	Abstract = {A serial reaction time (RT) (SRT) experiment
  investigated whether there are 2 independent forms of implicit
  learning: learning that is linked to making judgments about
  stimuli, and learning that is linked to motor processing.  180
  Ss performed 2, 6, or 12 blocks of single task SRT, dual task
  SRT, or observation with 1 of 5 sequences; each sequence had
  the same underlying structure.  Ss then performed 2 implicit
  tests, SRT (a motor-linked test) and pattern judgment, as well
  as a generation test and an explicit knowledge test.  Results
  show a double dissociation of the effect of sequence surface
  structure on SRT and pattern judgment.  SRT and pattern
  judgment competence developed independently of each other
  across length of acquisition task.  Performance on both
  implicit tasks did not depend on explicit knowledge.  These
  results indicate that the SRT and pattern judgment measures tap
  independent forms of implicit learning, which is consistent
  with the modular nature of memory and cognition.},

	Summary = {Authors use HMMs for automata induction from data. They outline a Bayesian approach to estimation of parameters, starting out with a saturated model, i.e.\ a model that has a state for each data point. This latter feature renders the method impractical for large datasets although authors mention online learning as an option. Most priors they chose are non-informative except possibly the structure prior for the number of states in a model which effectively gives a penalty for increasing numbers of states. However, the magnitude of this penalty is not given. In their automata induction example authors use a description length prior, which comes down to counting the number of non-zero parameters (which implicitly incorporates the number of states). Furthermore they use a Dirichlet prior for the parameter values which is biased to produce zeroes and ones in the transition and emission matrices but is generally uninformative. Also they maximize the Maximum Posterior Probability. The method seems very much to be identical to using AIC as selection criterion where the AIC is adjusted to only count the non-zero parameters.},
